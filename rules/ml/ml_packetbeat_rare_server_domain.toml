A machine learning job detected an unusual network destination domain name. This can be due to initial access,
persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing
email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon web server
name. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for
command-and-control communication.

    Web activity that occurs rarely in small quantities can trigger this alert. Possible examples are browsing technical
    support or vendor URLs that are used very sparsely. A user who visits a new and unique web destination may trigger
    this alert when the activity is sparse. Web applications that generate URLs unique to a transaction may trigger this
    when they are used sparsely. Web domains can be excluded in cases such as these.
